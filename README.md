## VPNProtect

This is a simple PHP app to restrict access to content if the connecting user is using a VPN. It uses the getipintel.net API for VPN detection, which provides a probabilistic response. By editing the values in config.php, you can restrict access based on the probability that the user is a VPN. Also allows you to configure an IP whitelist for IPs that will always be allowed in. Extremely useful if you're having spam issues and need to quickly lock down your site(s).
